title: Using Docker to pull image and then load the image in Minikube
---

I have introduced how to use the `minikube` command to download an image manually:

- [Ëß£ÂÜ≥minikubeÁöÑImagePullBackOffÈóÆÈ¢ò](https://weinan.io/2023/06/01/minikube.html)

However sometimes this method doesn‚Äôt work because of the network problem, so it‚Äôs better to use the underling `docker` command to pull the image manually with proxy set and then load it into `minikube`.

The `minikube` can have multiple choices as its underlying engines[^minikube_drivers]. Because I‚Äôm using MacOS, and I have installed Docker on my computer, so my `minikube` installation uses the Docker as its underlying engine by default.

So I can set the proxy in my Docker like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpics2023/main/0827/image.png)

As the screenshot shown above, I have set the `proxies` to my network vendor‚Äôs proxy, thus I can fetch the docker images via proxy. Now I can try to pull a image with the following command:

```bash
‚û§ docker pull jmalloc/echo-server

Using default tag: latest

latest: Pulling from jmalloc/echo-server
Digest: sha256:57110914108448e6692cd28fc602332357f91951d74ca12217a347b1f7df599c
Status: Image is up to date for jmalloc/echo-server:latest
docker.io/jmalloc/echo-server:latest
```

As the command output shown above, I have used the `docker` command to pull the image, and because the `docker` command will use the proxy setting, so it will download the image file via proxy. Now as the image is pulled into my local machine, now I can use the `minikube` command to load this image. Here is the command to do so:

```bash
‚û§ minikube image load jmalloc/echo-server
```

After the above command is executed, now we can use this image to create a deployment:

```bash
‚û§ kubectl create deployment hello-minikube1 --image=jmalloc/echo-server
deployment.apps/hello-minikube1 created
```

As the command output shown above, the deployment based on the pulled image is created. Now we can expose the deployment by creating a `LoadBalancer` typed service:

```bash
‚û§ kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube1 --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
service/hello-minikube1 exposed
```

Here is the created service:

```bash
‚û§ k get svc
NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
hello-minikube1   LoadBalancer   10.109.132.227   <pending>       8080:31711/TCP   2s
```

Now we can use the `minikube tunnel` command to expose this service to the host machine:

```bash
‚û§ minikube tunnel
‚úÖ  Tunnel successfully started

üìå  NOTE: Please do not close this terminal as this process must stay alive for the tunnel to be accessible ...

üèÉ  Starting tunnel for service hello-minikube1.
```

With the tunnel created by `minikube`, we can now access the service by using the `localhost` in host[^minikube_tunnel]:

```bash
‚û§ curl localhost:8080
Request served by hello-minikube1-7d547f95f4-zgbcw

GET / HTTP/1.1

Host: localhost:8080
Accept: */*
User-Agent: curl/8.1.2
```

Until now, we can see the service can be accessed from the host.
