title: Upgrade the `axum-playground` project to use `axum 0.6`
---

Recently I have upgraded my [GitHub - liweinan/axum-playground: My Axum Playground](https://github.com/liweinan/axum-playground) to use `axum 0.6`, which is a major version upgrade that breaks backward compatibility. Here is the release note of `axum 0.6`:

- [axum - v0.6.0](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/releases/tag/axum-v0.6.0)

The release note contains description to the changes, and how to fix the non backward compatibility issues.

Here are the changes in `axum-playground` upgrade:

- [liweinan/axum - upgrade axum to 0.6](https://github.com/liweinan/axum-playground/commit/41469ebcb946009735251d229ca66b336d47a819)

Here is a discussion related with the upgrade:
