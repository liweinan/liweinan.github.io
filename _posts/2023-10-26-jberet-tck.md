title: JBeret TCK Testing Process
---

I have recorded the process to do the TCK test for JBeret here:

- [https://github.com/jberet/jsr352/pull/381#issuecomment-1764776583](https://github.com/jberet/jsr352/pull/381#issuecomment-1764776583)

Currently, it's a manual process. In the future I plan to automate the testing process.
