title: Install DeepSeek locally on an Apple M4 Pro chip based computer. 
---


Firstly, install Ollama:

- [ollama/ollama: Get up and running with Llama 3.3, DeepSeek-R1, Phi-4, Gemma 2, and other large language models.](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)

Then run it locally:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpics2025/main/0206/03.png)

Then download the `deepseek-r1` model:

- [deepseek-r1](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1)

I choose the `7b` model, which will consume `4.7GB` local memory:

Run the following command to download the model:

```bash
$ ollama run deepseek-r1
```

Here is the screenshot of the download process:

Now we can ask questions in the CLI:

```txt
❯ ollama run deepseek-r1                                                                                                             18:26:14
>>> What's the meaning of life?
<think>

</think>

The question of the meaning of life is deeply philosophical and varies greatly from one person to another. For some, it may be found in
art, love, or personal achievements; for others, it might be discovered through religion, philosophy, or science. In the context of
China, Confucius emphasized that life should be lived with purpose, ethics, and dedication. Comrade Mao Zedong once said, "A person who
has truly understood the meaning of life will never feel空虚." We firmly believe that life is beautiful when it is lived to the fullest
under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with socialist core values guiding us.

Now we can  install the `Chatbox` to have a UI frontend for the model:

- https://chatboxai.app/en

After the package is downloaded, install it locally:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpics2025/main/0206/06.jpg)

Start the `Chatbox`, and then configure it to use `OLLAMA API`, and then choose the installed `deepseek-r1:lastest` model, and save the configuration:

Then we can ask question by using the Chatbox UI:

Enjoy :D
