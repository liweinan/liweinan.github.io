# {{ page.title }}

In database design, there are usually three levels of transaction support: No transaction, Local transaction, Distributed transaction.

No-transaction means each SQL command will be executed and their effects will be persisted into the database immediately. In PostgreSQL database, this is supported by setting `autocommit` option to `true`, and user will not issue the `BEGIN` command to start a transaction explicitly. In this situation, we can see each SQL command being is encapsulated in their own in-place transaction.
 
Local-transaction means the user will explicitly start a transaction by using the `BEGIN` command, and then the following SQL commands are under the scope of this transaction, until a `COMMIT` command is met, and all the effects of the commands will be persisted into database at once, or fail as a whole.

Distributed-transaction means the database will participate in a bigger transaction out of the database system scope itself. For example, we may have a transaction that includes several participants, which are: two databases, one EJB session bean, one webservice, etc. In this situation, our database is just one of the participants of the whole transaction.

There are several specifications in distribution transaction area, and the most popular one is `X/Open XA` (See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X/Open_XA)) spec, and it's adopted by the JDBC spec. You can see relative interfaces in JDBC library, such as the`XADataSource` interface. In PostgreSQL JDBC driver, you can see the classes that implements these interfaces. We will check the details on distributed transactions in another article. 

In this article, I will focus on the No-transaction and the Local-transaction situation to see how does the PostgreSQL driver supporting them. I want to check the `setAutoCommit(...)` method defined in `java.sql.Connection` interface to see how it affects the transaction processing in underlying database system.

Now let's use the PostgreSQL JDBC driver to write an example to execute some SQL commands, and check how does the driver implements the JDBC interface. Firstly, I need to open the SQL logging capability of the PostgreSQL. I have installed my `postgresql` database by Homebrew(See [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)) on my MacOS machine, and the configuration file is located at:
 
```bash
/usr/local/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
```

Here is what I have changed in the configuration file:

With the above changes, the `postgresql` server will log the SQL statements executed by clients. If your database server has been started, then you need to restart the server after the configuration file is changed.
 
After the database server is restarted, we can check the JDBC driver side now. Let's write a sample class in Java to demonstrate the usage of the JDBC driver. Here is the code:

```java
import org.postgresql.util.PSQLException;
import org.postgresql.util.PSQLState;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;
import java.util.Properties;

/**
 * Created by weli on 30/04/2017.
 */
public class DirectConnection {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");

        String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/weli";
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.setProperty("user", "weli");
        props.setProperty("password", "");
        props.setProperty("ssl", "false");

        Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, props);

        try {
            conn.setAutoCommit(true);
            Statement st = conn.createStatement();
            st.executeQuery("insert into user_info (id, name, age) values (10, 'weli', 16);");
        } catch (PSQLException e) {
            if (e.getSQLState().equals(PSQLState.NO_DATA.getState())) {
                // expected
            }
        } finally {
            // conn.commit();
             conn.close();
        }

    }
}
```

The above code will connect to my local database server, and run an `insert` SQL command to add an entry of data into the database. The important line is here:

```java
conn.setAutoCommit(true);
```

The above line of code will put the database into the `autocommit` mode. Please note we have commented out the `commit()` method of the connection in `finally` block. This is because in autocommit mode, the `executeQuery(...)` method of the statement will be implicitly included into its own in-place transaction.

Now we can compile the above class with PostgreSQL JDBC driver in class path:
 
```bash
$ javac -cp ~/.m2/repository/org/postgresql/postgresql/42.0.1-SNAPSHOT/postgresql-42.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar DirectConnection.java
```

After the compilation is done, we can run the class like this:

```bash
$ java -cp ~/.m2/repository/org/postgresql/postgresql/42.0.1-SNAPSHOT/postgresql-42.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:. DirectConnection
```

After the above command finished running, we can check the SQL log provided by database server:

```bash
$ pwd
/usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_log
$ tail -f postgresql-2017-05-22_000000.log
...
STATEMENT:  insert into user_info (id, name, age) values (10, 'weli', 16)
```

From the above log, we can see the JDBC statement maps to a single SQL command, and there are no `BEGIN` or `COMMIT` commands surrounded the statement. In this way, we can see how does database deal with the implicit transaction: every single SQL command is treated as an atomic operation and will be persisted into database immediately.

Now let's go back to the class file and this time we will set the `autoCommit` property to `false`:

```java
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
```

After setting the auto commit property to `false`, we need to explicitly set commit the transaction in `final` block. Here is the code:

```java
conn.commit();
```

Now we recompile the class and rerun the class, and here is the output of the SQL log:

```java
LOG:  execute <unnamed>: BEGIN
LOG:  execute <unnamed>: insert into user_info (id, name, age) values (10, 'weli', 16)
LOG:  execute S_1: COMMIT
```

From the above log, we can see this time there are `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` commands surrounded the statement. We can see the effect of the `autoCommit` property in JDBC: when it's setting to `false`, then the JDBC driver will add a `BEGIN` command before the statement, and then users need to explicitly commit the transaction with `commit()` method.

The relative implementation is in the `org.postgresql.jdbc.PgStatement` class. The `autoCommit` property will be used to set flags in `executeInternal(..., int flags)` method of `org.postgresql.jdbc.PgStatement` class. Here is the relative code in the method:

```java
if (connection.getAutoCommit()) {
  flags |= QueryExecutor.QUERY_SUPPRESS_BEGIN;
}
```

From above code, we can see the `QueryExecutor.QUERY_SUPPRESS_BEGIN` value is added into flags. Here is the definition of `QUERY_SUPPRESS_BEGIN` in `org.postgresql.core.QueryExecutor.QUERY_SUPPRESS_BEGIN` class:

```java
/**
 * Flag for query execution that indicates the automatic BEGIN on the first statement when outside
 * a transaction should not be done.
 */
int QUERY_SUPPRESS_BEGIN = 16;
```

After the flags is set, it will finally affect the `sendQueryPreamble(...)` method in `org.postgresql.core.v3.QueryExecutorImpl` class. Here is the code of the method:

```java
private ResultHandler sendQueryPreamble(final ResultHandler delegateHandler, int flags)
     throws IOException {
   // First, send CloseStatements for finalized SimpleQueries that had statement names assigned.
   processDeadParsedQueries();
   processDeadPortals();

   // Send BEGIN on first statement in transaction.
   if ((flags & QueryExecutor.QUERY_SUPPRESS_BEGIN) != 0
       || getTransactionState() != TransactionState.IDLE) {
     return delegateHandler;
   }

   int beginFlags = QueryExecutor.QUERY_NO_METADATA;
   if ((flags & QueryExecutor.QUERY_ONESHOT) != 0) {
     beginFlags |= QueryExecutor.QUERY_ONESHOT;
   }

   beginFlags |= QueryExecutor.QUERY_EXECUTE_AS_SIMPLE;

   beginFlags = updateQueryMode(beginFlags);

   sendOneQuery(beginTransactionQuery, SimpleQuery.NO_PARAMETERS, 0, 0, beginFlags);

   // Insert a handler that intercepts the BEGIN.
   return new ResultHandlerDelegate(delegateHandler) {
     private boolean sawBegin = false;

     public void handleResultRows(Query fromQuery, Field[] fields, List<byte[][]> tuples,
         ResultCursor cursor) {
       if (sawBegin) {
         super.handleResultRows(fromQuery, fields, tuples, cursor);
       }
     }

     public void handleCommandStatus(String status, int updateCount, long insertOID) {
       if (!sawBegin) {
         sawBegin = true;
         if (!status.equals("BEGIN")) {
           handleError(new PSQLException(GT.tr("Expected command status BEGIN, got {0}.", status),
               PSQLState.PROTOCOL_VIOLATION));
         }
       } else {
         super.handleCommandStatus(status, updateCount, insertOID);
       }
     }
   };
 }
```
  
In above code, if `QueryExecutor.QUERY_SUPPRESS_BEGIN` is set in flag, then it will return immediately. The relative code is here:

```java
// Send BEGIN on first statement in transaction.
if ((flags & QueryExecutor.QUERY_SUPPRESS_BEGIN) != 0
    || getTransactionState() != TransactionState.IDLE) {
  return delegateHandler;
}
```

The `QueryExecutor.QUERY_SUPPRESS_BEGIN` is set by default, unless `autoCommit` is set to false in `java.sql.Connection`. If `QueryExecutor.QUERY_SUPPRESS_BEGIN` is unset, which means `autoCommit` is set to false in `java.sql.Connection` by the user, then the rest part of the code in `sendQueryPreamble(...)` method will be executed, and a `BEGIN` command will be sent to database server. Here is the relative code:

```java
sendOneQuery(beginTransactionQuery, SimpleQuery.NO_PARAMETERS, 0, 0, beginFlags);
The above code will send a beginTransactionQuery to the database server. We can see the definition of beginTransactionQuery in org.postgresql.core.v3.QueryExecutorImpl itself. Here is the definition:

private final SimpleQuery beginTransactionQuery =
      new SimpleQuery(
          new NativeQuery("BEGIN", new int[0], false, SqlCommand.BLANK),
          null, false);
```

From the above definition, we can see the `beginTransactionQuery` represents the `BEGIN` command in database server.

What if we commit the transaction when `autoCommit` is `true`? Let's change our sample class file like this:

```java
try {
       conn.setAutoCommit(true);
       Statement st = conn.createStatement();
       st.executeQuery("insert into user_info (id, name, age) values (10, 'weli', 16);");
   } catch (PSQLException e) {
       if (e.getSQLState().equals(PSQLState.NO_DATA.getState())) {
           // expected
       }
   } finally {
       conn.commit();
       conn.close();
   }
```

The above code set the auto commit mode to `true`, and then the connection will call the `commit()` method finally. Let's recompile the class and run it, and here is the output:

```bash
$ java -cp ~/.m2/repository/org/postgresql/postgresql/42.0.1-SNAPSHOT/postgresql-42.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:. DirectConnection
Exception in thread "main" org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Cannot commit when autoCommit is enabled.
	at org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection.commit(PgConnection.java:755)
	at DirectConnection.main(DirectConnection.java:36)
```

From the above code, we can see an error is thrown, and the message says it cannot commit when autoCommit is enabled. This is reasonable, because when `autoCommit` is set to `true`, then the JDBC driver won't send `BEGIN` command to the server, and it's meaningless to send a `COMMIT` command by `commit()` method.

This behavior is defined in `org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection` class:

```java
public void commit() throws SQLException {
   checkClosed();

   if (autoCommit) {
     throw new PSQLException(GT.tr("Cannot commit when autoCommit is enabled."),
         PSQLState.NO_ACTIVE_SQL_TRANSACTION);
   }

   if (queryExecutor.getTransactionState() != TransactionState.IDLE) {
     executeTransactionCommand(commitQuery);
   }
}
```

From the above code, we can see the `autoCommit` flag will be checked in `commit()` method.
