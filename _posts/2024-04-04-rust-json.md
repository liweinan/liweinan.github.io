title: Rust Tuple to Json
---
 

Here is the code to convert a rust tuple to JSON string:

```rust
    let my_list: Vec<(i32, String)> = vec![
        (1, "abc".to_string()),
        (2, "feg".to_string()),
        (3, "xyz".to_string()),
    ];
    let serialized = serde_json::to_string(&my_list).unwrap();

    println!("serialized = {}", serialized);
```

Here is the output of the code:

```json
serialized = [[1,"abc"],[2,"feg"],[3,"xyz"]]
```

As the output shown above, we can see the tuple type is serialized as  JSON arrays.
