title: Using Github Package together with Github Action
---


These two articles introduces how to use the Github Package Registry to deploy Maven artifacts and how to refer to the package in another project:

- [How to use a private Maven repository in Artifactory with GitHub Actions](https://www.schakko.de/2020/05/24/how-to-use-a-private-maven-repository-in-artifactory-with-github-actions/)
- [Using GitHub Workflow with Maven dependencices from a private GitHub Package Registry](https://www.schakko.de/2020/12/19/using-github-workflow-with-maven-dependencies-from-a-private-github-package-registry/)

The above two articles are well written, so I won’t cover too many details in this blog post, and I’ll just write down some notes regarding with the usages.

Suppose there are two Github hosted Maven based projects called `Foo` and `Bar`:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpics2023/main/0815/github_maven.jpg)

As the diagram shown above the project `Bar` depends on project `Foo`. Suppose the project `Foo` has a stream version:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<project xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"
         xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>io.my</groupId>
    <artifactId>foo</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
...
</project>
```

Which means the head version of project `Foo` will always be `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`. In project `Bar` the `pom.xml` contains a dependency item like this:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.my</groupId>
    <artifactId>foo</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Which means the project `Bar` will always use the `SNAP` version of the project `Foo`. To make `Foo` be able to be referred by `Bar`, we need to deploy the `Foo`  to Github Package. Because the above articles have introduces the details about this process, so I will just give some notes here and won’t go through the whole process. In general, in the `pom.xml` of project `Foo`, it needs to add the GitHub repository like this:

```xml
<distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <name>Foo Package</name>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/<your_account_name>/<your_project_name></url>
    </repository>
</distributionManagement>
```

The above `distributionManagement` tells Maven the position that the project needs to be deployed to, then we can build and the project `Foo`:

```bash
$ mvn install
```

And then we can do the deployment with the following command:

```bash
$ mvn deploy
```

The above command will deploy the built package to Github Package. Taking one of my person projects for example:

- [https://github.com/liweinan/java-snippets](https://github.com/liweinan/java-snippets)

In the `pom.xml` of the project it has the `distributionManagement` setting like this:

```xml
<distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <name>weli's java-snippets package</name>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/liweinan/java-snippets</url>
    </repository>
</distributionManagement>
```

Here is the output of the `mvn deploy` command:

```

```

From the above output we can see the package is deployed to:

- `https://maven.pkg.github.com/liweinan/java-snippets/io/weli/java-snippets/1.0-SNAPSHOT/java-snippets-1.0-20230814.154741-1.jar`

Please not there is timestamp automatically added at the end of the version number. This feature is important to avoid version conflict for each build and deployment. Here is the package page of the `java-snippets`:

- [https://github.com/liweinan/java-snippets/packages/1921974](https://github.com/liweinan/java-snippets/packages/1921974)

And in the page you can see the different versions I’ve already deployed to Github Package. As we deployed the package by running the `mvn deploy` command locally after building the package locally. To automate this process, we can setup the Github Action like this:

- [java-snippets/.github/workflows/maven.yml at master · liweinan/java-snippets](https://github.com/liweinan/java-snippets/blob/master/.github/workflows/maven.yml)

I won’t go through the details, but here are some notes: Firstly the Maven setting need to be set in the action:

```yaml
    - name: Set up JDK 19
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '19'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        server-id: github # Value of the distributionManagement/repository/id field of the pom.xml
        settings-path: $\{\{ github.workspace \}\} # location for the settings.xml file
```

And in the deployment step the auto-generated `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to be set:

```yaml
    - name: Deploy
      run: mvn -s $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/settings.xml deploy
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: $\{\{ github.token \}\}
```

> Note: I have to escape all the double parentheses in this blog post, or it won't display. 

Because I owned this repository, so this generated token can have the access to upload the package of this project. Now as the package is hosted in Github Package, we can start to use the package. Because this `java-snippet` project is public, so you just need to set the repository in the `pom.xml` of the project that want to refer to the package (Use `Foo` in `Bar` for example). Here is the setting example:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <name>weli's java-snippets package</name>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/liweinan/java-snippets</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

And then add the dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.weli</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-snippets</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

To sum up, here is the example:

- [https://github.com/liweinan/use-java-snippets/blob/main/pom.xml](https://github.com/liweinan/use-java-snippets/blob/main/pom.xml)

To run this example, you can clone the repository into your local environment and run the Maven command:

```bash
$ mvn install
```

And in the above command output you can see something like this:

```
...
Downloading from github: https://maven.pkg.github.com/liweinan/java-snippets/io/weli/java-snippets/1.0-SNAPSHOT/java-snippets-1.0-20230814.163936-4.pom
Downloaded from github: https://maven.pkg.github.com/liweinan/java-snippets/io/weli/java-snippets/1.0-SNAPSHOT/java-snippets-1.0-20230814.163936-4.pom (8.0 kB at 3.2 kB/s)
...
```

So the `java-snippets` package can be downloaded from the Github Package.

The above setting is for the public project and package, if the package `Foo` is private, the situation goes complicated, because you need to set up the access token and use it properly. I won’t go into the details on how to generate the Github Repository Token with necessary privileges to access the private repository and the package, because the articles I referred in the beginning of this blog post already describes all the details. In general, you need to have a token that can have the access to read the package, and put it in your local Maven config file `~/.m2/settings.xml`. Here is my settings in my local configuration file for example:

```xml
<servers>
        <server>
            <id>github</id>
            <username>liweinan</username>
            <password>my_token</password>
        </server>
</servers>
```

In the above setting, `liweinan` is my Github account name and the password is the token I generated from Github that can access my private repository and package. Please note the `id` of the server needs to be conformed with the `repositories` and the `distributionManagement` id settings, or Maven can’t use the above setting accordingly.

If you want to automate the build process in Github Action, then you also need to setup the above security settings properly. The articles I referred to in the beginning of this blog post contains the detail on how to set it properly, and here are some notes:

First you need to put this setting in your `maven.yml` of your project `Bar`, which depends on `Foo` in building process:

```yaml
- name: Set up JDK 17
  uses: actions/setup-java@v3
  with:
    java-version: '17'
    distribution: 'adopt'
    server-id: github # Value of the distributionManagement/repository/id field of the pom.xml
    settings-path: $\{\{ github.workspace \}\} # location for the settings.xml file
    server-username: GITHUB_USER_REF  # env variable name for username
    server-password: GITHUB_TOKEN_REF # env variable name for GitHub Personal Access Token
```

And the above `GITHUB_USER_REF` and `GITHUB_TOKEN_REF` are Github Action environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  GITHUB_USER_REF: $\{\{ secrets.GH_PACKAGE_REPO_USERNAME \}\}
  GITHUB_TOKEN_REF: $\{\{ secrets.GH_PACKAGE_REPO_PASSWORD \}\}
```

These are called Github Repository Secrets that you should define in your project’s Repository Secret section like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpics2023/main/0815/image.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpics2023/main/0815/image%202.png)

As the screenshots shown above, the `GH_PACKAGE_REPO_USERNAME` is my Github account name `liweinan`, which can have access to my personal private repo, and the `GH_PACKAGE_REPO_PASSWORD` is the token I generated that can have access to my private repo’s packages.

To sum up, here is an example Github Action setting that works:

- [https://github.com/liweinan/use-java-snippets/blob/main/.github/workflows/maven.yml](https://github.com/liweinan/use-java-snippets/blob/main/.github/workflows/maven.yml)

Please note the `java-snippets` project in the example is a public project, so we don’t have to set up the token in Github Action, but for private repos and its packages, the above setting is a must-have.

Above is the notes I want to share with you on using the Github Package and Github Action, hope it's useful to you :D
