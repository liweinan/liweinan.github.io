title: Spring 6 + RESTEasy 6 Sample Project Deployment With WildFly Preview Release.
--- 

Both Spring 6 and RESTEasy 6 adopts EE9 spec and namespaces, and there are releases of `resteasy-spring` that adopts the Spring and RESTEasy 6:

- [https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-spring/releases/tag/3.0.0.Alpha1](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-spring/releases/tag/3.0.0.Alpha1)

To show how to use this version of `resteasy-spring` with the preview version of WildFly(which also supports EE9 spec), I have committed to the `resteasy-spring-basic` example showing how to do this:

- [resteasy-examples/resteasy-spring-basic at main · resteasy/resteasy-examples · GitHub](https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy-examples/tree/main/resteasy-spring-basic)

Please read the README of the sample project to see how to use it:
