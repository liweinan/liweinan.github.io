title: Function As Constructor In Javascript
---

We can defined a function like this in javascript:

```javascript
function Foo(v) { this.v = v; }
```

And if we assign it to a variable like this:

```javascript
let x1 = Foo(1);
```

The `Foo` instance itself is actually bind to global object. And in web browser, the global object is `window`. We can confirm this by printing out `x1` in Chrome Javascript Console:

We can see `x1` is `undefined`, and `Foo(1)` is actually bound to `window` object:

So if we want to bind it to a variable, we need the `new` operator:

```javascript
let x2 = new Foo(42);
```

In this way we can assign the `Foo` instance to `x2` variable. Here is the screenshot of the code output:

From above we can see that `x2` is a `Foo` object.
