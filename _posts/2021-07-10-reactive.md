title: (Java) Relationship of Reactive Stream and Reactor Projects
--- 

The `reactivestreams` project define the standard APIs in this field:

- [GitHub - reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm: Reactive Streams Specification for the JVM](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm)

Here are the core interfaces:

The above interfaces are the core structures defined in `org.reactivestreams`.

Another popular project, `spring-reactor`, implements the above standard project:

- [reactor / Reactive Streams based projects for backpressure-ready asynchronous message passing](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core)

In the project, there are two important classes, `Flux` and `Mono`, implements `CorePublisher`, and `CorePublisher` implements `Publisher` interface from `org.reactivestream`:

From above we can see both `Flux` and `Mono` are implementations of `Publisher`.

In JBoss Mutiny, it has support to the `reactor` project:

- [SmallRye Mutiny :: Integration with Reactor](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-mutiny/tree/main/reactor)

In above module of Mutiny, it provides a series of helpers to convert Reactor classes:

From above we can see the adapter provides multiple methods to convert `Flux` and `Mono` to Mutiny classes.

In addition RxJava also provides adaptor like this:

- [GitHub - ReactiveX/RxJavaReactiveStreams: Adapter between RxJava and ReactiveStreams](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaReactiveStreams)

Which I wonâ€™t explore in this post.
