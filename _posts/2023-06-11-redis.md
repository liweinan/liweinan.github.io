title: Merging Redis Databases

Install the `redis-rdb-tools` and follow the way to export `rdb` file to command line file:

- [Emitting Redis Protocol](https://github.com/sripathikrishnan/redis-rdb-tools/blob/master/README.md#emitting-redis-protocol)

For example:

```bash
$ rdb -c protocol new.rdb.save > new.rdb.cmd
```

```bash
$ rdb -c protocol old.rdb.save > old.rdb.cmd
```

The `cmd` file contains the redis commands.

Start a new `redis-server` with an empty `rdb` file, and load the two command files with the `redis-cli` command:

```bash
$ cat old.rdb.cmd | redis-cli --pipe
All data transferred. Waiting for the last reply...
Last reply received from server.
errors: 0, replies: 2903
```

```bash
$ cat new.rdb.cmd | redis-cli --pipe
All data transferred. Waiting for the last reply...
Last reply received from server.
errors: 0, replies: 94
```

Save the database:

```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> save
OK
```
