title: Directly Calling Anonymous Function In Javascript
---

In Javascript we can define a anonymous function and directly call it like this:

```javascript
((x) => x*2)(24)
```

In above we defined an anonymous function, which accept a parameter `x` and double its value then return. And we directly call it by passing argument `24` into it. And here is the output of the function:

We can see the function is directly called and the result `48` is the result.
