From the above diagram, we can see the relationship between the projects. Here is the `ChannelMavenArtifactRepositoryManager` for example:

From the above diagram, we can see the `org.wildfly.prospero.galleon.ChannelMavenArtifactRepositoryManager` implements the `org.jboss.galleon.universe.maven.repo.MavenRepoManager` interface, and it uses the `org.wildfly.channel.ChannelSession` from the `wildfly-channels` project.
