In previous article, I have introduced the JDBC driver loading process in Wildfly. In this article, I'd like to show you the datasource loading process.

Firstly, let's review the datasource and driver configuration in `standalone.xml`:

```xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:datasources:4.0">
    <datasources>
        <datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/weli" pool-name="weli" enabled="true" use-java-context="true">
            <connection-url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost/weli</connection-url>
            <driver>postgresql</driver>
            <security>
                <user-name>weli</user-name>
            </security>
        </datasource>
        <drivers>
            <driver name="postgresql" module="org.postgresql"/>
        </drivers>
    </datasources>
</subsystem>
```

The above XML data defines our PostgreSQL datasource and the driver. I have removed the sample H2 database configuration to focus on our PostgreSQL topic. In previous article, we have seen how does the `postgresql` driver is loaded into Wildfly. The Wildfly server uses `JdbcDriverAdd` class to do the driver loading work, and it will find the `Driver` interface implementation for us automatically.

Now we should check how does Wildfly load the `datasource`. From the above configuration, we can see the `datasource` and `driver` are actually two independent elements. In the `datasource` configuration, it refers to the driver with the `driver` item. Here is the snippet:

```xml
<driver>postgresql</driver>
```

So we can guess in the Wildfly code, the datasource will refer to the driver in such a loose way. Now let's the Wildfly code side. The core class that deals with the datasource loading is `AbstractDataSourceAdd`. It is an abstract class that contains most of the code, and `DataSourceAdd` class extends it to add several addition methods. Here is the class diagram of these two classes:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/DataSourceAdd.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/DataSourceAdd.png)

From the above diagram, we can see the `AbstractDataSourceAdd` class contains a `performRuntime(...)` method. This is the entry point of the datasource handler, and we will check it in detail later. (Besides `DataSourceAdd` class, there is another class called `XaDataSourceAdd` that implements the `AbstractDataSourcceAdd` class. We won't discuss the two phase commit in this article, so we won't check the `XaDataSourceAdd` class.)

I set several breakpoints in the `performRuntime(...)` method of the `AbstractDataSourceAdd` class and start the Wildfly server in standalone mode. Here is the screenshot that the code stopped at breakpoint:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/firstRuntimeStep.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/firstRuntimeStep.png)

The above screenshot shows that the `performRuntime(...)` method will call the `firstRuntimeStep(...)` method.

I have set a breakpoint in `firstRuntimeStep(...)` method, and here is the screenshot:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/firstRuntimeStep.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/firstRuntimeStep2.png)

From the above screenshot, we can see in `firstRuntimeStep(...)` method it will create an instance of `AbstractDataSourceService` class by `createDataSourceService(dsName, jndiName)` method. This is an abstract method that will be implemented by `DataSourceAdd` class or the `XaDataSourceAdd` class.

In our example, because we are using `datasource` setting in configuration, and not the `xa-datasource`, so we are actually using the `DataSourceAdd.createDataSourceService(...)` method to create the an instance of `LocalDataSourceService`. Here is the screenshot of the code in the method:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/DataSourceAdd.createDataSourceService.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/DataSourceAdd.createDataSourceService.png)

From the above screenshot, we can see an instance of `LocalDataSourceService` is created.

Here is the screenshot of the code running process:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/DataSourceService.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/DataSourceService.png)

From the above diagram, we can see the instance of `AbstractDataSourceService` is actually `LocalDataSourceService`. Now let's check the class diagram of these data source services:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/DataSourceServices.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/DataSourceServices.png)

The above diagram shows the `AbstractDataSourceService` and its two implementation classes: `LocalDataSourceService` and `XaDataSourceService`. There is an important field in the  `AbstractDataSourceService` class, which is `sqlDataSource : WildFlyDataSource`. The `WildFlyDataSource` is the datasource type finally returned to the user. We will verify this later. Here is the class diagram of `WildFlyDataSource`:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/WildFlyDataSource.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/WildFlyDataSource.png)

In this datasource class, the important methods are these `getConnection(...)` methods. Users will get the database connections from the datasource, and don't care whether these connections are pooled or not. Let's see the code in `WildFlyDataSource`:

```java
public class WildFlyDataSource implements DataSource, Serializable {
    /** DataSource */
    private transient DataSource delegate;
    
    public Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
        return delegate.getConnection();
    }
...
```

From the above code, we can see `WildFlyDataSource` will just use a `delegate` datasource to do the real work. To see how does `WildFlyDataSource` being created, we need to go back to `DataSourceAdd.createDataSourceService(...)` method to see how does `LocalDataSourceService` get created. Here is the code:

```java
protected AbstractDataSourceService createDataSourceService(final String dsName,final String jndiName) throws OperationFailedException {
   return new LocalDataSourceService(dsName, ContextNames.bindInfoFor(jndiName));
}
```

The above code shows that an instance of `LocalDataSourceService` will be created, and its `WildFlyDataSource` will be initialized during creation process. Let's check the code of `LocalDataSourceService`:

```java
package org.jboss.as.connector.subsystems.datasources;

import org.jboss.as.naming.deployment.ContextNames;
import org.jboss.jca.common.api.validator.ValidateException;
import org.jboss.msc.inject.Injector;
import org.jboss.msc.value.InjectedValue;

/**
 * Local data-source service implementation.
 * @author John Bailey
 * @author Stefano Maestri
 */
public class LocalDataSourceService extends AbstractDataSourceService {

    private final InjectedValue<ModifiableDataSource> dataSourceConfig = new InjectedValue<ModifiableDataSource>();

    public LocalDataSourceService(final String dsName, final ContextNames.BindInfo jndiName, final ClassLoader classLoader) {
        super(dsName, jndiName, classLoader);
    }

    public LocalDataSourceService(final String dsName, final ContextNames.BindInfo jndiName) {
        super(dsName, jndiName, null);
    }

    @Override
    public AS7DataSourceDeployer getDeployer() throws ValidateException {
        return new AS7DataSourceDeployer(dataSourceConfig.getValue().getUnModifiableInstance());
    }

    public Injector<ModifiableDataSource> getDataSourceConfigInjector() {
        return dataSourceConfig;
    }
}
```

From the class definition, we can see the `LocalDataSourceService` class extends the `AbstractDataSourceService` class, and the constructor of the `LocalDataSourceService` class will just call the constructor `AbstractDataSourceService` class.

We have seen the class diagram of `AbstractDataSourceService` class in above, and we see the class stores the necessary attributes of a data source. The constructor of `AbstractDataSourceService` code is listed in below:

```java
protected AbstractDataSourceService(final String dsName, final ContextNames.BindInfo jndiName, final ClassLoader classLoader ) {
    this.dsName = dsName;
    this.classLoader = classLoader;
    this.jndiName = jndiName;
}
```

From the above code, we can see the `AbstractDataSourceService` class will store the name and JNDI name of a datasource. This info is extracted from the configuration file (`standalone.xml` in standalone mode) set by the users.

Now we can check the `start(...)` method of the `AbstractDataSourceService`. Here is the sequence diagram the `start(...)` method:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/org.jboss.as.connector.subsystems.datasources.AbstractDataSourceService.start(StartContext).png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/org.jboss.as.connector.subsystems.datasources.AbstractDataSourceService.start(StartContext).png)

From the above diagram, we can see that the instance of `WildFlyDataSource` is created in `start(...)` method. To create the `WildFlyDataSource` class instance, it uses the `AS7DataSourceDeployer` to deploy a `CommonDeployment` (the instance name is `deploymentMD`) into the Wildfly container.

The `AS7DataSourceDeploy` class is an inner class of `AbstractDataSourceService` class, and its core part is the `deploy(...)` method. Basicially speaking, the `deploy(...)` method will register the datasource information and its driver reference into the container, and prepare the `CommonDeployment` to fetch the `WildFlyDataSource` from it. Here is the sequence diagram of the `AbstractDataSourceService.deploy(...)` method:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/AS7DataSourceDeployer.deploy(ServiceContainer).png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/AS7DataSourceDeployer.deploy(ServiceContainer).png)

From the above diagram, we can see that the datasource and its referred driver infomation will be wrapped into `dataSourceConfig : org.jboss.jca.common.api.metadata.ds.DataSource`. This is the important thing we should know: Wildfly is using the JCA architecture([Java EE Connector Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_EE_Connector_Architecture)) to wrap the datasource. In Wildfly, the JCA implementation is provided by the IronJacamar project([http://www.ironjacamar.org/](http://www.ironjacamar.org/)). We can't dive into too many details of this part in this article, and I'll articles on the topic in future.

Now let's go back to the `AbstractDataSourceService.start(...)` method:

```java
public synchronized void start(StartContext startContext) throws StartException {
    try {
        final ServiceContainer container = startContext.getController().getServiceContainer();

        deploymentMD = getDeployer().deploy(container);
        if (deploymentMD.getCfs().length != 1) {
            throw ConnectorLogger.ROOT_LOGGER.cannotStartDs();
        }
        sqlDataSource = new WildFlyDataSource((javax.sql.DataSource) deploymentMD.getCfs()[0], jndiName.getAbsoluteJndiName());
...
```

From the above code, we can see that the `WildFlyDataSource` is created from the `org.jboss.jca.deployers.common.CommonDeployment`. In conclusion, our datasource and its relying driver information is registered into the connector system, and the datasource is managed by the connector system.

In addition, we can see the driver loading process and the datasource loading process are independent from each other. The driver loading is handled by `JdbcDriverAdd` as we saw in last chapter, and the datasource loading is handled by `DataSourceAdd` as we learned in this article.

During the `DataSourceAdd` loading process, it will just record the JDBC driver needed by the Datasource, but it will not perform the action to connect the driver with datasource. We can verify this by setting multiple breakpoints in the code, and check when does the server will add the driver to the datasource. I have set some breakpoints in `AbstractDataSourceAdd` and `AbstractDataSourceService` and we will use them. In addition, let's modify the datasource config in `standalone.xml` a little bit:

```xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:datasources:4.0">
    <datasources>
        <datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/weli" pool-name="weli" enabled="true" use-java-context="true">
            <connection-url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost/weli</connection-url>
            <driver>void</driver>
            <security>
                <user-name>weli</user-name>
            </security>
        </datasource>
        <drivers>
            <driver name="postgresql" module="org.postgresql"/>
        </drivers>
    </datasources>
</subsystem>
```

From the above code, we can see our datasource refers to a driver named `void`, and this driver is not configured anywhere. We can deduce that the Wildfly server will throw error for this config, because it can't find the `void` driver for the datasource. Now let's run the Wildfly server in standalone mode to see what happened:

```bash
$ ./standalone.sh
...

    ]

        "org.wildfly.data-source.weli is missing [jboss.jdbc-driver.void]"

}

```

I have extracted the relative log from server output. From the above output, we can see the `datasources` subsystem is started, and the `postgresql` driver is installed successfuly. During the datasource loading process, it reports error that it can not find the `void` driver. This is what we expected.

Now let's stop the server and restart it in debug mode to do the more fine-grained analysis. The first breakpoint that the startup process met is shown in below screenshot:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/breakpoint-ds1.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/breakpoint-ds1.png)

The above screenshot will start to register the datasource. Now let's continue the server startup process, until it met the second breakpoint:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/breakpoint-ds2.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/breakpoint-ds2.png)

From the above screenshot, we can see the code stops at the last line of `AbstractDataSourceAdd.firstRuntimeStep(...)`, and the last step is to add driver demander of the datasource. Until this point, the server still haven't load the driver, and it just add the datasource with the connector. Then I continued the server startup process, and this time the code stopped at the breakpoint I set in `JdbcDriverAdd`:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/breakpoint-ds3.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liweinan/blogpicbackup/master/data/jdbc/breakpoint-ds3.png)

This is reasonable because in `standalone.xml` we can see the `driver` setting is in below of the `datasource` setting.  

```xml
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:datasources:4.0">
    <datasources>
        <datasource jndi-name="java:jboss/datasources/weli" pool-name="weli" enabled="true" use-java-context="true">
            <connection-url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost/weli</connection-url>
            <driver>void</driver>
            <security>
                <user-name>weli</user-name>
            </security>
        </datasource>
        <drivers>
            <driver name="postgresql" module="org.postgresql"/>
        </drivers>
    </datasources>
</subsystem>
```

From the above configuration, we can see that the the `driver` section is belowing the `datasource` section, but in `datasource` section it refers to the driver with `driver` item. By setting the breakpoints in `AbstractDataSourceAdd` and `JdbcDriverAdd`, we can also confirm the `AbstractDataSourceAdd` executed before the `JdbcDriverAdd`. In conclusion, the Wildfly datasource subsystem will connect the datasource with its driver after loading them independently.

Finally I continued the startup process, and the `JdbcDriverAdd` successfully installed the jdbc driver. At last, the `org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation` module threw the error as we see in above. We won't dive into details of the `management-operation` in this article.

In this article, I have introduced the datasource loading process. In next article, I'll introduce the usage of datasource in Wildfly.
