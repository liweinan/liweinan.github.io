# {{ page.title }}

In last part of the series of the articles, we have made a sample project to load the PostgreSQL JDBC driver into the running Java virtual machine. In this part, we will examine the JDBC driver startup process.

In our example, we have written a `DirectConnection` class to load and use the JDBC driver. The code to load the JDBC driver is this line at the beginning of the class:
  
```java
Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");
```

The above line of code used the `java.lang.Class.forName(...)` method to invoke the class loader to load the `org.postgresql.Driver` class. The `org.postgresql.Driver` class implements the `java.sql.Driver` interface, and it provides the methods to connect to the underlying database server.

Database vendors should implement their own drivers. From the users perspective, they can use the standard JDBC APIs to connect to the underlying database system without worrying about the differences between database vendors.

Here is the class diagram of the `org.postgresql.Driver`:

From the above class diagram, we can see the `org.postgresql.Driver` class has a `connect(...)` method to handle the connection to the underlying database server. Here is the relative code in `connect(...)` method to make the connection:

```java
return makeConnection(url, props);
```

From above code, we can see the `connect(...)` method calls the `makeConnection(...)` method for database connection. Here is the code of `makeConnection(...)` method:

```
private static Connection makeConnection(String url, Properties props) throws SQLException {
	return new PgConnection(hostSpecs(props), user(props), database(props), props, url);
}
```

From above code, we can see that an instance of `org.postgresql.PgConnection` class is created. `PgConnection` is a huge class that wraps the calls and operations to underlying database. We will check the detail of this class later.

In `org.postgresql.Driver`, there is static code that will be called during class loading. Here is the relative code:

```java
static {
	try {
	  // moved the registerDriver from the constructor to here
	  // because some clients call the driver themselves (I know, as
	  // my early jdbc work did - and that was based on other examples).
	  // Placing it here, means that the driver is registered once only.
	  register();
	} catch (SQLException e) {
	  throw new ExceptionInInitializerError(e);
	}
}
```

The above static code will call `register()` method to register the driver itself into `java.sql.DriverManager`. Here is the code of `register()` method:

```java
/**
 * Register the driver against {@link DriverManager}. This is done automatically when the class is
 * loaded. Dropping the driver from DriverManager's list is possible using {@link #deregister()}
 * method.
 *
 * @throws IllegalStateException if the driver is already registered
 * @throws SQLException if registering the driver fails
 */
public static void register() throws SQLException {
  if (isRegistered()) {
    throw new IllegalStateException(
        "Driver is already registered. It can only be registered once.");
  }
  Driver registeredDriver = new Driver();
  DriverManager.registerDriver(registeredDriver);
  Driver.registeredDriver = registeredDriver;
}
```

From above code, we can see the `register()` method in `org.postgresql.Driver` class register itself into the `java.sql.DriverManager` class. The `java.sql.DriverManager` is provided by JDK. It's not an interface,  instead it is a class provided by JDBC library that for managing all the database drivers loaded into Java virtual machine. All the driver implementations need to register itself into DriverManager during class loading phase. The `org.postgresql.Driver` follows this rule as we see in above. Here is the class diagram of the `java.sql.DriverManager` class:

![/assets/jdbc/DriverManager.png](/assets/jdbc/DriverManager.png)

From the above diagram, we can see that the `java.sql.DriverManager` provides methods like `registerDriver(...)` and `deregisterDriver(...)` for the drivers to register or deregister themselves. In addition, it provides `getConnection(...)` methods to the users. In our own `DirectConnection` example, we use the `java.sql.DriverManager` to get the connection, and here is the relative code:

```java
String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/weli";
Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty("user","weli");
props.setProperty("password","");
props.setProperty("ssl","false");

Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, props);
```

The above code defines the properties of our local database server, and pass it to `java.sql.DriverManager` to get the connection. Because the `org.postgresql.Driver` has been registered into `java.sql.DriverManager`, so it can find the the correct driver and call it the make physical connections to underlying database system.

The url to connect to our PostgreSQL database server is `jdbc:postgresql://localhost/weli`. The `java.sql.DriverManager` used this information to find the correct driver to use. On the other side, the `org.postgresql.Driver` class needs to detect the `jdbc:postgresql` string correctly to handle the connection request sent by `java.sql.DriverManager`. Here is the relative code in the `connect(...)` method of `org.postgresql.Driver`:

```java
public java.sql.Connection connect(String url, Properties info) throws SQLException {
  // get defaults
  Properties defaults;

  if (!url.startsWith("jdbc:postgresql:")) {
    return null;
  }
...
```

The above code shows that the `connect(...)` method of the `org.postgresql.Driver` will check if the request is for "jdbc:postgresql:". If the connection request isn't for PostgreSQL database, it will just return null and let `java.sql.DriverManager` to try other database drivers. The `getConnection(...)` method in `java.sql.DriverManager` will traverse the registered database drivers to see who can handle the connection request from the user. Here is the relative code in `getConnection(...)` method:

```java
for(DriverInfo aDriver : registeredDrivers) {
    // If the caller does not have permission to load the driver then
    // skip it.
    if(isDriverAllowed(aDriver.driver, callerCL)) {
        try {
            println("    trying " + aDriver.driver.getClass().getName());
            Connection con = aDriver.driver.connect(url, info);
            if (con != null) {
                // Success!
                println("getConnection returning " + aDriver.driver.getClass().getName());
                return (con);
            }
        } catch (SQLException ex) {
            if (reason == null) {
                reason = ex;
            }
        }

    } else {
        println("    skipping: " + aDriver.getClass().getName());
    }

}
```

From the above code, we can see `java.sql.DriverManager` will check each registered database driver, and try to use it to handle the connect request. If a driver can handle the connection, it will return the `java.sql.Connection` class. For PostgreSQL driver, it will return the `PgConnection` class instance. We have seen this in `makeConnection(...)` method of `org.postgresql.Driver` class, which is called by the `connect(...)` method.

Until now, we have learned the loading process of the JDBC driver. In addition, we hav checked how does JDBC manages the drivers and use them to interact with the underlying database system. In the next part of the articles, let's check the `java.sql.Connection` and `org.postgresql.PGConnection` classes in detail.
