# {{ page.title }}

In the previous articles, we have learned the basic aspects of the JDBC specification and the implementation of the PostgreSQL driver. In this article, I'd like to go on checking another important part of the JDBC specification([JDBCâ„¢ 4.1  Specification](http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/jdbc-4_1-mrel-spec/jdbc4.1-fr-spec.pdf?AuthParam=1494474283_bf1014b01227d16877a00b038e2e7e82)): Connection pooling.

In JDBC specification, it defines a three-tier layer structure for the users to get connection from a managed data source pool. Here is the diagram from the specification:
 
![/assets/jdbc/pooling.png](/assets/jdbc/pooling.png)

In above diagram, we can see the data source is designed to be provided by application server. For example, Wildfly as an application server should take the responsibility to provide a database connection pool to the users. On the JDBC driver layer, it needs to implement two interfaces defined by JDBC specification. Here is the class diagram of the two interfaces:

![/assets/jdbc/interfaces.png](/assets/jdbc/interfaces.png)

The above diagram shows the two interfaces from JDK source that should be implemented by the JDBC driver, which are `javax.sql.PooledConnection` and `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource`.

From the above diagram, we can see the `ConnectionPoolDataSource` interface defines a `getPooledConnection()` method that will return a `javax.sql.PooledConnection` typed data.

The `PooledConnection` interface defines the `getConnection()` method that will return a `java.sql.Connection` typed data.

The purpose of the design is to allow the implementation of the `PooledConnection` and `ConnectionPoolDataSource` to manage the underlying `Connection` to the database. In this way, the JDBC driver can handle the `Connection` instance returned from `PooledConnection` to manage its lifecycle the data pool.

Here is the class diagram about the implementation of the above two interfaces in PostgreSQL JDBC driver:

![/assets/jdbc/org.postgresql.ds.png](/assets/jdbc/org.postgresql.ds.png)

The above diagram shows the implementation of the interfaces in the driver. The `org.postgresql.ds.PGPooledConnection` implements the `javax.sql.PooledConnection` interface, and the `org.postgresql.ds.PGConnectionPoolDataSource` implements the `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource`. We will check the design of these two classes later in the article.

These two interfaces do not care about the detail pool implementation, and usually in application server the connection pool implementation can be configured and replaced with multiple choices.   

In this article, I won't use an application server as the datasource provider. In PostgreSQL JDBC driver, it provides a sample pooling implementation class named `org.postgresql.ds.PGPoolingDataSource`. We will use it as our demonstration implementation in this article.

Firstly, let's write a class to use the `org.postgresql.ds.PGPoolingDataSource` to fetch a connection from the pool:

```
package io.weinan.jdbc;

import org.postgresql.ds.PGPoolingDataSource;

/**
 * Created by weli on 01/05/2017.
 */
public class PlayWithPGPoolingDataSource {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        PGPoolingDataSource dataSource = new PGPoolingDataSource();
        dataSource.setDataSourceName("jdbc:postgresql://localhost/weli");
        dataSource.setUser("weli");
        dataSource.setPassword("");

        System.out.println(dataSource.getConnection());

    }
}
```

The above code creates a `PGPoolingDataSource` class instance, and we set relative parameters for the class to connect to the database server. We use the `getConnection()` method of the `dataSource` to get the connection from the connection pool. Running the above code could get the following result:

```
Pooled connection wrapping physical connection org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection@497470ed
class com.sun.proxy.$Proxy0
```

From the above output, we can see a wrapper proxy instance around `org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection` being returned to the user.

From the users perspective, they don't care about the implementation of the connection instance, they will just use it as an ordinary connection interface and call the methods to operate on the database.

If users call the `close` method of the connection, it will actually be returned to the connection pool instead of really being closed. This is implemented in the `org.postgresql.ds.PGPooledConnection` class.

Let's check the class diagram of the `org.postgresql.ds.PGPooledConnection` in detail:

![/assets/jdbc/org.postgresql.ds.PGPooledConnection.png](/assets/jdbc/org.postgresql.ds.PGPooledConnection.png)

From the above diagram, we can see the connection instanced is proxied, and it is actually the inner class `ConnectionHandler` inside the `org.postgresql.jdbc.ds.PGPooledConnection` class.

Here is the debug process screenshot that proves the above conclusion:

![/assets/jdbc/pool_conn_proxy.png](/assets/jdbc/pool_conn_proxy.png)

From the above screenshot, you can see I have set the breakpoint at the `conn` instance returned from the data source. In the inspection window of IntelliJ IDEA, we can see the real class of the `conn` is `PGPooledConnection$ConnectionHandler`. Remember that `conn` has the type of `java.sql.Connection`, so the users will just treat it as ordinary connection to the database.

The job of `PGPooledConnection$ConnectionHandler` proxy is to dispatch the calls to the `org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection` that makes physical connections with the database server.

`org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection` is the class that implements the `java.sql.Connection` interface, and it will make the physical connection with underlying database system.
 
The `org.postgresql.ds.PGPooledConnection$ConnectionHandler` proxy will handle the `org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection`. Now let's check the code of the `org.postgresql.ds.PGPoolingDataSource` class to see how it manages the lifecycle of the physical connection.

Here is the code of `org.postgresql.ds.PGPooledConnection$ConnectionHandler` class:

```java
  /**
   * Instead of declaring a class implementing Connection, which would have to be updated for every
   * JDK rev, use a dynamic proxy to handle all calls through the Connection interface. This is the
   * part that requires JDK 1.3 or higher, though JDK 1.2 could be supported with a 3rd-party proxy
   * package.
   */
  private class ConnectionHandler implements InvocationHandler {
    private Connection con;
    private Connection proxy; // the Connection the client is currently using, which is a proxy
    private boolean automatic = false;

    public ConnectionHandler(Connection con) {
      this.con = con;
    }

    public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
      final String methodName = method.getName();
      // From Object
      if (method.getDeclaringClass() == Object.class) {
        if (methodName.equals("toString")) {
          return "Pooled connection wrapping physical connection " + con;
        }
        if (methodName.equals("equals")) {
          return proxy == args[0];
        }
        if (methodName.equals("hashCode")) {
          return System.identityHashCode(proxy);
        }
        try {
          return method.invoke(con, args);
        } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {
          throw e.getTargetException();
        }
      }

      // All the rest is from the Connection or PGConnection interface
      if (methodName.equals("isClosed")) {
        return con == null || con.isClosed();
      }
      if (methodName.equals("close")) {
        // we are already closed and a double close
        // is not an error.
        if (con == null) {
          return null;
        }

        SQLException ex = null;
        if (!con.isClosed()) {
          if (!isXA && !con.getAutoCommit()) {
            try {
              con.rollback();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
              ex = e;
            }
          }
          con.clearWarnings();
        }
        con = null;
        this.proxy = null;
        last = null;
        fireConnectionClosed();
        if (ex != null) {
          throw ex;
        }
        return null;
      }
      if (con == null || con.isClosed()) {
        throw new PSQLException(automatic
            ? GT.tr(
                "Connection has been closed automatically because a new connection was opened for the same PooledConnection or the PooledConnection has been closed.")
            : GT.tr("Connection has been closed."), PSQLState.CONNECTION_DOES_NOT_EXIST);
      }

      // From here on in, we invoke via reflection, catch exceptions,
      // and check if they're fatal before rethrowing.
      try {
        if (methodName.equals("createStatement")) {
          Statement st = (Statement) method.invoke(con, args);
          return Proxy.newProxyInstance(getClass().getClassLoader(),
              new Class[]{Statement.class, org.postgresql.PGStatement.class},
              new StatementHandler(this, st));
        } else if (methodName.equals("prepareCall")) {
          Statement st = (Statement) method.invoke(con, args);
          return Proxy.newProxyInstance(getClass().getClassLoader(),
              new Class[]{CallableStatement.class, org.postgresql.PGStatement.class},
              new StatementHandler(this, st));
        } else if (methodName.equals("prepareStatement")) {
          Statement st = (Statement) method.invoke(con, args);
          return Proxy.newProxyInstance(getClass().getClassLoader(),
              new Class[]{PreparedStatement.class, org.postgresql.PGStatement.class},
              new StatementHandler(this, st));
        } else {
          return method.invoke(con, args);
        }
      } catch (final InvocationTargetException ite) {
        final Throwable te = ite.getTargetException();
        if (te instanceof SQLException) {
          fireConnectionError((SQLException) te); // Tell listeners about exception if it's fatal
        }
        throw te;
      }
    }

    Connection getProxy() {
      return proxy;
    }

    void setProxy(Connection proxy) {
      this.proxy = proxy;
    }

    public void close() {
      if (con != null) {
        automatic = true;
      }
      con = null;
      proxy = null;
      // No close event fired here: see JDBC 2.0 Optional Package spec section 6.3
    }

    public boolean isClosed() {
      return con == null;
    }
  }
```

From the above code, we can see the `invoke(...)` method in the `ConnectionHandler` wraps around the `Method` of `Connection`. For example, it handles the event like connection close. Here is the relative code:
 
```java
fireConnectionClosed();
```

Now let's check the code of this `fireConnectionClosed()` method:

```java
/**
  * Used to fire a connection closed event to all listeners.
  */
 void fireConnectionClosed() {
   ConnectionEvent evt = null;
   // Copy the listener list so the listener can remove itself during this method call
   ConnectionEventListener[] local =
       listeners.toArray(new ConnectionEventListener[listeners.size()]);
   for (ConnectionEventListener listener : local) {
     if (evt == null) {
       evt = createConnectionEvent(null);
     }
     listener.connectionClosed(evt);
   }
 }
```

From the above code, we can see the `fireConnectionClosed()` method will create an instance of `ConnectionEvent` class and register it into an instance of `ConnectionEventListener`, and finally the listener will fire the `connectionClosed(...)` event.

The `ConnectionEvent` and `ConnectionEventListener` are two interfaces provided by the JDBC specification, and it is the container's job to implement them properly to handle the event in a pooling environment. For example, in the `PGPoolingDataSource` demo datasource implementation, it will just return the connection back to its pool instead of really closing it. In the real container like Wildfly, it will rely on its pooling provider to manage the events (Apache Commons DBCP is a popular connection pooling provider used by many application servers). We will check the detail of the `PGPoolingDataSource` later in the article.

Now let's see the class diagram of the `javax.sql.ConnectionEvent` and `javax.sql.ConnectionEventListener` interfaces:

![/assets/jdbc/pooling.png](/assets/jdbc/events.png)

From the above diagram, we can see the main job of the `ConnectionEventListener` interface is to handle the `connectionClosed(...)` method, and the `ConnectionEvent` will be passed in as the context. Now we need to check the implementation of the `PGPoolingDataSource` to see how to implement a pooling data source.

![/assets/jdbc/org.postgresql.dsPGPoolingDataSource.png](/assets/jdbc/org.postgresql.dsPGPoolingDataSource.png)

The above `org.postgresql.ds.PGPoolingDataSource` is a demo class that implements a simple data source pool. Firstly let's check how does it stores connections in a "pool". Here are the relative data structures in the class:  

```
private Stack<PooledConnection> available = new Stack();
private Stack<PooledConnection> used = new Stack();
```

From the above code, we can see there are two stacks to store its "pooled" connections: one is named `available` and the other is called `used`. Besides the above two stacks, the `PGPoolingDataSource` class also stores a `PGConnectionPoolDataSource` instance:

```
private PGConnectionPoolDataSource source;
```

From the above code, we can see an instance of `PGConnectionPoolDataSource` that implements the `javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource` interface is stored. Let's now review the usages of `ConnectionPoolDataSource` interface: it defines a `getPooledConnection()` that will be used to return a `javax.sql.PooledConnection`, and the `javax.sql.PooledConnection` will return a managed `Connection` instance from the pool. In PostgreSQL driver, the `org.postgresql.ds.PGPooledConnection` implements the `javax.sql.PooledConnection` interface, and will return a `ConnectionHandler` proxy class that wraps around the physical `org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection` instance.

Next, the `ConnectionHandler` proxy will wrap the connection methods with event listener, and the event listener will be handled properly by the pooling vendor. Our pooling vendor is `PGPoolingDataSource`, which is a demo class to show how to implement a data source pool. 

Now let's go back to `PGPoolingDataSource` to see how it initializes the data source. Here is the `initialize()` method in the class:

```
/**
 * Initializes this DataSource. If the initialConnections is greater than zero, that number of
 * connections will be created. After this method is called, the DataSource properties cannot be
 * changed. If you do not call this explicitly, it will be called the first time you get a
 * connection from the DataSource.
 *
 * @throws SQLException Occurs when the initialConnections is greater than zero, but the
 *         DataSource is not able to create enough physical connections.
 */
public void initialize() throws SQLException {
  synchronized (lock) {
    source = createConnectionPool();
    try {
      source.initializeFrom(this);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      throw new PSQLException(GT.tr("Failed to setup DataSource."), PSQLState.UNEXPECTED_ERROR,
          e);
    }

    while (available.size() < initialConnections) {
      available.push(source.getPooledConnection());
    }

    initialized = true;
  }
}
```

The above code shows some important tasks that `initialize()` method will perform. Firstly, it will create a `PGConnectionPoolDataSource` instance. Here is the code:

```
source = createConnectionPool();
```

The above code will create an instance of the `PGConnectionPoolDataSource`. The data source will be used to create some idle connections and pushed into the `available` stack. Here is the code:

```
while (available.size() < initialConnections) {
  available.push(source.getPooledConnection());
}
```

From the above code, we can see some connections are created initially and pushed to the `available` stack. This is a cache scheme for demonstration. Now we should check how does the connections are fetched from the stack. Here is the  `getPooledConnection()` method that takes the task:

```
private Connection getPooledConnection() throws SQLException {
    PooledConnection pc = null;
    Object var2 = this.lock;
    synchronized(this.lock) {
        if(this.available == null) {
            throw new PSQLException(GT.tr("DataSource has been closed.", new Object[0]), PSQLState.CONNECTION_DOES_NOT_EXIST);
        }

        while(true) {
            if(!this.available.isEmpty()) {
                pc = (PooledConnection)this.available.pop();
                this.used.push(pc);
                break;
            } else if(this.maxConnections != 0 && this.used.size() >= this.maxConnections) {
                try {
                    this.lock.wait(1000L);
                } catch (InterruptedException var5) {
                    ;
                }
            } else {
                pc = this.source.getPooledConnection();
                this.used.push(pc);
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    pc.addConnectionEventListener(this.connectionEventListener);
    return pc.getConnection();
}
```

The above method shows us how does a connection fetched from the stack. Here is the relative part of the code:

```
pc = (PooledConnection)this.available.pop();
this.used.push(pc);
```

From the above code we can see there will be a connection poped from the `available` stack, and it will be pushed it into the `used` stack. Finally the connection will be returned to the caller. If `maxConnections` are reached, it means there is no usable connection in the `available` stack. In this condition, the process will wait for for 1 second for the available connections to be returned back to the stack and try again:

```
else if(this.maxConnections != 0 && this.used.size() >= this.maxConnections) {
...
this.lock.wait(1000L);
...
}
```

The above logic is very low efficient, that's why this `PGPoolingDataSource` class is just for demonstration and can't be used in production field. In application server, we'll have more powerful connection pool solutions.
 
Now let's go on our code reading. If the number of connections in the `available` stack does not meet the `maxConnections`, it will create a new connection from the data source and immediately pushed into `used` stack:

```
...
pc = this.source.getPooledConnection();
this.used.push(pc);
...

```

The above code shows the new connection is created and pushed into the `used` stack. Now we know if the connection is being used by a thread, it will be kept into the `used` stack.

Now let's think about this question: how does the connection moved from `used` stack back to `available` stack? The answer is: this is achieved by the listener pattern. In `getPooledConnection()` method, we can see a event listener is added to the pooled connection. The code is like this:

```
pc.addConnectionEventListener(this.connectionEventListener);
```

From the above code, we can see the `connectionEventListerner` instance is added into the `PooledConnection pc` instance. The connection listener will finally be called with its `connectionClosed(...)` method, and the method is actually implemented by the pooling provider. So it is job of the `PGPoolingDataSource` demo class to implement the logic itself. Here is how the `ConnectionEventListener` inner class in `PGPoolingDataSource` class that implements it for demonstration purpose:

```
/**
 * Notified when a pooled connection is closed, or a fatal error occurs on a pooled connection.
 * This is the only way connections are marked as unused.
 */
private ConnectionEventListener connectionEventListener = new ConnectionEventListener() {
  public void connectionClosed(ConnectionEvent event) {
    ((PooledConnection) event.getSource()).removeConnectionEventListener(this);
    synchronized (lock) {
      if (available == null) {
        return; // DataSource has been closed
      }
      boolean removed = used.remove(event.getSource());
      if (removed) {
        available.push((PooledConnection) event.getSource());
        // There's now a new connection available
        lock.notify();
      } else {
        // a connection error occurred
      }
    }
  }

  /**
   * This is only called for fatal errors, where the physical connection is useless afterward and
   * should be removed from the pool.
   */
  public void connectionErrorOccurred(ConnectionEvent event) {
    ((PooledConnection) event.getSource()).removeConnectionEventListener(this);
    synchronized (lock) {
      if (available == null) {
        return; // DataSource has been closed
      }
      used.remove(event.getSource());
      // We're now at least 1 connection under the max
      lock.notify();
    }
  }
};
```

From the above code, we can see that when a pooled connection is closed, it will be returned back to the `available` pool and removed from `used` pool. The connection won't be really closed actually.

Now let's see how does `org.postgresql.ds.PGPooledConnection` class call the above implemented listener. Here is the code: 

```
private final List<ConnectionEventListener> listeners = new LinkedList<ConnectionEventListener>();
...
/**
 * Adds a listener for close or fatal error events on the connection handed out to a client.
 */
public void addConnectionEventListener(ConnectionEventListener connectionEventListener) {
  listeners.add(connectionEventListener);
}

/**
 * Removes a listener for close or fatal error events on the connection handed out to a client.
 */
public void removeConnectionEventListener(ConnectionEventListener connectionEventListener) {
  listeners.remove(connectionEventListener);
}
...
/**
 * Used to fire a connection closed event to all listeners.
 */
void fireConnectionClosed() {
  ConnectionEvent evt = null;
  // Copy the listener list so the listener can remove itself during this method call
  ConnectionEventListener[] local =
      listeners.toArray(new ConnectionEventListener[listeners.size()]);
  for (ConnectionEventListener listener : local) {
    if (evt == null) {
      evt = createConnectionEvent(null);
    }
    listener.connectionClosed(evt);
  }
}

/**
 * Used to fire a connection error event to all listeners.
 */
void fireConnectionFatalError(SQLException e) {
  ConnectionEvent evt = null;
  // Copy the listener list so the listener can remove itself during this method call
  ConnectionEventListener[] local =
      listeners.toArray(new ConnectionEventListener[listeners.size()]);
  for (ConnectionEventListener listener : local) {
    if (evt == null) {
      evt = createConnectionEvent(e);
    }
    listener.connectionErrorOccurred(evt);
  }
}
...
```

From the above code, we can see the listeners are stored in `listeners` linked list. These methods will be called in the inner class `ConnectionHandler`, which is the proxy class represents the connection as we have seen. We can see the `fireConnectionClosed()` is called when the user invoke the `close()` method of the connection.

From user's perspective, they don't need to care about these underlying implementations, and they just use the connection interface as common to interact with the underlying database. From the database manager's perspective, they can change or tune the data pooling provider in the application server level. In our example, we use a very simple data pooling provider named `PGPoolingDataSource`. We even don't have to implement a pool at all and just provide a single connection to the users. For example, there is a 'PGSimpleDataSource' class provided by PostgreSQL driver that will not provide any 'pooling', and it will just pass every connection request to the underlying physical connections. Here is the code of the class:

```java
package org.postgresql.ds;

import org.postgresql.ds.common.BaseDataSource;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.sql.SQLException;

import javax.sql.DataSource;

/**
 * Simple DataSource which does not perform connection pooling. In order to use the DataSource, you
 * must set the property databaseName. The settings for serverName, portNumber, user, and password
 * are optional. Note: these properties are declared in the superclass.
 *
 * @author Aaron Mulder (ammulder@chariotsolutions.com)
 */
public class PGSimpleDataSource extends BaseDataSource implements DataSource, Serializable {
...
}
```

From the above code, we can see the `PGSimpleDataSource` is just a thin layer that didn't provide any data source pool inside. In this article, I have showed you the JDBC connection pool design, and we have checked a demo implementation of the architecture. We can see the whole design is very flexible, it decouples three kind of people: the user of the data base, the data base driver developer, the connection pool provider. We haven't checked the real connection pool provider in an application server. For example, Wildfly uses Apache Commons DBCP as its connection pool provider.

I plan to write article to introduce the data source in Wildfly, but it will be out of the scope of this series of the articles. In the next article, I'd like to introduce the transaction aspect of the JDBC specification.
